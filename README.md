### Animal Detector

This is a functional streamlit app for applying Microsoft AI for Earth's Megadetector to images of animals. The app currently runs locally.

This app was developed for a bit of consulting work for an environmental consulting company in California. I gave this presentation in early Novemember 2020 to show them how I used open models and open source tools (streamlit, tensorflow) to remove tens of thousands of uninteresting camera trap photos that did not contain animals.
